        "text": "Millions of people use online dating apps or social networking sites to meet someone. But instead of finding romance, many find a scammer trying to trick them into sending money. Read about the stories romance scammers make up and learn the number one way to avoid a romance scam.\n\nWhat Is a Romance Scam?\n\nYou meet someone special on a dating website or app. Soon they want to email, call, or message you off the platform. They say it’s true love, but they live far away — maybe for work or because they’re in the military. Then they start asking for money. Maybe it’s for a plane ticket to visit you. Or emergency surgery. Or something else urgent.\n\nRomance scammers create fake profiles on dating sites and apps or contact you through popular social media sites like Instagram or Facebook. The scammers strike up a relationship with you to build up trust, sometimes talking or chatting several times a day. Then, they make up a story and ask for money.\n\nPeople reported a record $547 million in losses to romance scams in 2021. That’s up about 80% from the reports the FTC got in 2020. In 2021, people reported paying romance scammers more with gift cards than with any other payment method. The 2021 reports also showed that cryptocurrency payments were the most costly.\n\nThe Lies Romance Scammers Tell\n\nRomance scammers adjust their story to what they think will work in each situation.\n\nScammers say they can’t meet you in person. They might say they’re living or traveling outside the country, working on an oil rig, in the military, or working with an international organization.\n\nScammers will ask you for money. Once they gain your trust, they’ll ask for your help to pay medical expenses (for them or a family member), buy their ticket to visit you, pay for their visa, or help them pay fees to get them out of trouble. They may even offer to help you get started in cryptocurrency investing.\n\nScammers will tell you how to pay. All scammers, not just romance scammers, want to get your money quickly. And they want your money in a way that makes it hard for you to get it back. They’ll tell you to wire money through a company like Western Union or MoneyGram, put money on gift cards (like Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, or Steam) and give them the PIN codes, send money through a money transfer app, or transfer cryptocurrency.\n\nScammers do these things to pressure you into acting immediately by paying money. But it’s a scam.\n\nHow to Avoid Losing Money to a Romance Scammer\n\nHere’s the bottom line: Never send money or gifts to a sweetheart you haven’t met in person.\n\nIf you suspect a romance scam:\n\nStop communicating with the person immediately.\n\nTalk to someone you trust. Do your friends or family say they’re concerned about your new love interest?\n\nSearch online for the type of job the person has plus the word “scammer.” Have other people posted similar stories? For example, search for “oil rig scammer” or “US Army scammer.”\n\nDo a reverse image search of the person’s profile picture. Is it associated with another name or with details that don’t match up? Those are signs of a scam.\n\nHow to Report a Romance Scam\n\nIf you paid a romance scammer with a gift card, wire transfer, credit or debit card, or cryptocurrency, contact the company or your bank right away. Tell them you paid a scammer and ask them to refund your money.\n\nIf you think it’s a scam, report it to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov. Notify the social networking site or app where you met the scammer, too.\n\nSearch Terms\n\nScams",

        "text": "Almost 70,000 people in the US reported romance scams in 2022, resulting in around $1.3 billion in losses, according to the FTC. If you’re looking for love online, or you use dating platforms and social media to make new connections, it’s important to ensure you don’t become the victim of a fraudster in the future.\n\nWhat are romance scams?\n\nRomance scams\n\nRomance scams are a common type of con in which fraudsters build up romantic connections with their victims before they steal money or information from them. They may seem harmless at first, but after gaining a victim’s trust, these individuals can be very dangerous.\n\nRomance scammers will often attempt to gain cash or other valuable assets, sensitive images that can be used for extortion, or a victim’s personal information so that they can use their identity to obtain things like credit cards and loans.\n\nTypes of love scams\n\nRomance scammers use a number of shady tactics to steal from their victims. These can include catfishing, creating fake dating websites that spread malware or steal sensitive data, blackmailing them with sensitive photos, and claiming to be overseas doctors, military personnel, and more.\n\nCatfishing (fake online dating profiles)\n\nRomance scammers asking for money\n\nFake online dating and “hookup” sites\n\nBlackmail and extortion using your sensitive photos (sextortion)\n\nInheritance scams\n\nPhishing for personal information (identity theft romance scams)\n\nOnline dating cryptocurrency investment scams\n\nGetting you to visit phishing and malware-infected websites\n\nOverseas doctors, developers, or military romance scams\n\n1. Catfishing (fake online dating profiles)\n\nCatfishing is a term used to describe a romance scam tactic in which a person pretends to be someone they’re not. They may create a fictional persona and use random images they’ve found online, or they may steal someone else’s name, personal details, and photos. Sometimes, catfishers will target a specific victim, but they will often entertain any attention that can get.\n\nTo lure in their victims, catfishers will pretend to be romantically interested in an unsuspecting person. This typically happens by message, email, and phone call—but not over a video call, which would give away the catfisher’s true identity. Once they have developed a relationship with their target, catfishers will use manipulation to get what they can from them (usually, it is money or presents).\n\n2. Romance scammers asking for money\n\nThe main objective for many romance scammers is to get their victims to send them money. Once they have built up a connection with an innocent individual, they will begin to ask for financial help. This will often involve an “emergency” or a sob story of some kind. For example, the scammer may claim they cannot afford their rent, that their car needs repairs, or that their pet is sick.\n\nWhatever the case may be, the scammer will insist they need money fast. They will often ask for funds to be sent as gift cards, prepaid debit cards, or via a bank or wire transfer. This may happen many times before the victim decides enough is enough, at which point the scammer will lose interest in them and move onto scamming their next target.\n\n3. Fake online dating and “hookup” sites\n\nSingles looking for love can sometimes be incredibly vulnerable, which is why some scammers see them as easy targets. They will set up scam dating and “hookup” websites, promising genuine relationships and legitimate meetups. Unfortunately, the truth is that these websites are complete scams and are usually designed to steal a user’s information.\n\nThese sites will often ask users to answer questions or fill out some kind of questionnaire, which will ask for sensitive information that no dating website should need—such as details about your finances and answers to common security questions, such as your mother’s maiden name. Once the scammers have that information, they can use it for all kinds of nefarious activities.\n\n4. Blackmail and extortion using your sensitive photos (sextortion)\n\nThink twice about sending sensitive photos of yourself to someone you barely know. Some scammers make it their mission to obtain images like these, and then they’ll use them to blackmail and extort their victims. This will usually involve threatening to send the photos to a boss or friends and family members unless the victim agrees to pay some money.\n\nOur “What is Sextortion?” guide will teach you more about this. It’s also important to remember that it’s not just scammers themselves you have to watch out for when sending sensitive images. Others may share your images in online groups and forums or forward them to friends without your knowledge. This is often how these images end up in the hands of con artists.\n\n5. Inheritance scams\n\nInheritance scams are more complex and elaborate than most other romance scams, but they certainly occur on an all too regular basis. With this trick, a scammer claims that they must marry to claim an inheritance—which they will suggest is worth millions of dollars—left by a close friend or relative. They’ll insist marriage is necessary to avoid duties or marriage taxes.\n\nOnce the scammer feels like they have built up enough of a rapport with their victim, they ask for help to bring the inheritance into the victim’s country. They will offer to travel and meet their victim to prove they are genuine—but only if the victim can pay for their flight. You may not be surprised to learn that once the scammer has received that cash, they usually disappear.\n\n6. Phishing for personal information (identity theft romance scams)\n\nPhishing scams are incredibly common in today’s world, and some scammers combine these with romance scams in an effort to exploit or take advantage of another person’s feelings. Similar to other scams on this list, the objective is to gather sensitive personal information, which can be used for various illegal financial activities.\n\nThis often includes fraudulently applying for things like credit cards, loans, and phone contracts—which the scammer will obviously never pay for, leaving their victims liable for the debts. You can avoid scams like these by never sharing sensitive information like your date of birth, Social Security number, banking details, and address with others.\n\n7. Online dating cryptocurrency investment scams\n\nCryptocurrencies have become incredibly popular and extremely valuable in recent years, which has led to an unsurprising rise in crypto investment scams of all types. Once a scammer has formed a relationship with their victim, they will claim to be some kind of “investment manager” who can supposedly help their love interest make a lot of money.\n\nThey will then persuade their victim to buy valuable cryptocurrencies—which can be incredibly difficult to trace—and deposit them in the victim’s own wallet. Alternatively, they might use scam cryptocurrency websites to steal digital assets when a user connects to them. In most cases, cryptocurrencies can never be recovered, so scams like these are getting increasingly popular.\n\n8. Getting you to visit phishing and malware-infected websites\n\nThe internet is filled with phishing and malware-infected websites today, and by following safe browsing practices, it’s not too difficult to avoid them. However, some romance scammers try their utmost to get victims to visit these pages, where their personal details may be stolen, or their devices may be infected with malware and viruses without their knowledge.\n\nScammers will often send links to these sites through messaging platforms or through online dating sites like Tinder and Match.com. Many will claim the site is a personal website or blog, where their love interest can see more pictures of them or learn more about them. Whenever someone on a dating site pushes you to visit a link, it’s best to view it (and them) with suspicion.\n\nFortunately, you don't have to be on the lookout for suspicious websites all the time—you can get Clario AntiSpy to do it for you. Clario AntiSpy’s web extension will let you know if the website is safe to browse or if it seems dangerous.\n\nFollow these simple steps to enjoy the four pillars of Clario AntiSpy’s Safe browsing:\n\nDownload Clario AntiSpy and get a subscription to create a profile\n\nOn the left-side menu, click Safe browsing\n\n3. Install and enable the Clario extension (available for Chrome and Safari)\n\n4. Enjoy Clario’s web protection!\n\n9. Overseas doctors, developers, or military romance scams\n\nWith these scams, swindlers use the names and identities of real doctors, developers, military personnel, and other trusted professionals in an effort to make them appear more appealing online. They will regularly use technical jargon associated with these roles, and make references to things like military bases, to make their act more convincing.\n\nOnce they have gained their victim’s trust over time, the scammer will then claim they have to be “deployed” overseas. Soon after, they will use a variety of tactics to try to take money from their victim, like claiming their own bank accounts or credit cards are temporarily blocked, that they do not have access to an ATM, and more.\n\nMilitary romance scams, in particular, have become so common that the US Army has published a fact sheet on how to spot and avoid scammers claiming to be American soldiers. “The Army reports that several senior officers and enlisted Soldiers throughout the Army have had their identities stolen and used in these scams,” reads the article.\n\nSigns of an online dating scammer\n\nWhile online dating scams like these have become a worrying trend, the good news is that it’s not too difficult to avoid potentially dangerous love schemes. Most of them follow a very similar trend: the fraudster lies to build up trust and a false romantic connection with their victim and then uses that to obtain money, personal information, and more.\n\nHere are some common signs of an online dating scammer that you should look out for:\n\nAn obviously fake profile and photos\n\nRefusal to meet in person or on a video call\n\nFrequent claims and stories that seem suspicious or too good to be true\n\nClaiming they are in love soon after meeting and using other “love-scamming” tricks\n\nAsking for money and personal information they do not need to know\n\nAsking you to visit websites or download apps\n\nAsking you to buy cryptocurrencies, gift cards, and prepaid debit cards\n\nOnline dating scammers are using increasingly sophisticated tactics in an effort to steal from their victims, but there are common signs that will often give them away. These include using fake profiles and images, refusing to meet in person or on a video call, and asking for money or personal information.\n\nHow to report a romance scammer\n\nIf you, unfortunately, fall victim to a romance scam, it’s important to report it. It’s completely normal to feel embarrassed or ashamed or like you want to simply move on and not tell anyone. But when you report a romance scammer, you help protect others from these individuals and make it harder for them to successfully execute their schemes.\n\nDepending on how the scam was carried out, you may have a number of options. Suspicious messages should be reported to the dating or social media platform on which they were received, such as Tinder or Facebook. If the scammer has taken money from you, it should be reported to your bank—especially if you used a wire transfer, which can be traced.\n\nIf you suspect a romance scammer has stolen your identity, this should be reported to the police in your country for investigation. In the United States, you can report scams to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov, and in other countries, you can file a report with similar government or law enforcement agencies.\n\nYou can help prevent online dating and romance scams by reporting suspicious behavior and signs of fraudulent activity. Dubious messages should be reported to the dating or social media platform on which they were sent, and you should also tell law enforcement and the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.\n\nHow to protect yourself from relationship fraud\n\nIt may be tempting to trust a seemingly kind stranger when you’re looking for love, particularly when that person appears to be very eager, and they make all kinds of exciting promises, but it’s vitally important to ensure that you only form connections with genuine people. There are some steps you can take to protect yourself from relationship fraud and love scamming:\n\nDon’t share sensitive personal details with people you do not know\n\nDon’t share contact details or addresses\n\nNever send or receive money, gift cards, or cryptocurrencies\n\nNever share your bank details, Social Security number, or card numbers\n\nUse only trusted and well-established dating websites\n\nConsider your actions before video calling or sharing sensitive photos\n\nTrust your gut instincts\n\nOf course, it may be difficult to avoid some of these things once you start to form a genuine connection with someone. For instance, you may want to give out your phone number or meet someone on a video call if things are going well—and it’s safe to do that once you have established that the person you’re speaking to is authentic and trustworthy.\n\nPerhaps the most important step is the last one: trust your gut instincts. Follow the advice above to spot potential fraudsters and be on your guard. If a person is overly keen or they seem too good to be true, they usually are.\n\nYou can enjoy safe online dating and protect yourself from dating scams by not sharing sensitive personal details, never sending money or revealing your banking information, using only trusted dating platforms, and considering your actions before joining video calls or sending sensitive photos.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we’ve explained throughout this article, romance scams are a very real threat, and there are a number of popular tactics in use that you should know. However, there’s no need to avoid online dating altogether. By being aware of common scams and learning the signs you should look out for when building connections online, you can protect yourself from relationship fraud.",

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) received some 56,000 complaints about romance scams in 2021, more than triple the 2017 total, and reported monetary losses from such cons jumped sixfold over the same period, to $547 million.\n\nThe con typically works something like this: You post a dating profile and up pops a promising match — good-looking, smart, funny and personable. Supposed suitors might also reach out on social media; more than a third of people who lost money to a romance scam in 2021 reported that it started on Facebook or Instagram, according to the FTC. They’ll use pictures of an attractive person, of course; check out Social Catfish’s list of the top 100 photos used for catfishing (using a fake identity to lure someone into a romantic relationship) in 2022.\n\nThis potential mate claims to live in another part of the country or to be abroad for business or a military deployment. But he or she seems smitten and eager to get to know you better, and suggests you move your relationship to a private channel like email or a chat app.\n\nOver weeks or months, you feel yourself growing closer. You make plans to meet in person, but for your new love something always comes up. Then you get an urgent request. There’s an emergency (a medical problem, perhaps, or a business crisis) and your online companion needs you to send money fast, usually via gift cards, prepaid debit cards, cryptocurrency, or a bank or wire transfer.\n\nThey'll promise to pay it back, but that will never happen. Instead, they will keep asking for more until you realize it's a scam and cut them off.\n\nRomance scams can overlap with or evolve into other forms of fraud. For example, international criminal gangs use dating sites to recruit unwitting “money mules” to launder ill-gotten funds through their bank accounts or other means. And con artists are increasingly luring supposed sweethearts into fraudulent cryptocurrency investments.\n\nThe older the target, the heavier the financial toll. The median individual loss from a romance scam for people 70 and over was $9,000 in 2021, according to the FTC, compared to $2,400 across all age groups.",

        "text": "Looking for love online?\n\n“Deborah” fell hard when she met her Spanish lumberjack on a dating site in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. He was 66, somewhat attractive and looked uncannily like Deborah’s late husband who died just months before the pandemic hit.\n\n“I was missing not having him here to talk about, you know, what was going on in the world and everything,” Deborah said. “So, somebody suggested to go online through a dating service … and this guy’s pictures shows up and he’s just you know, no George Clooney, nothing gorgeous, but in fact, he had a resemblance to my husband.”\n\nFor Deborah, who was in her late 60s and looking to start over after the loss of her husband, it was a perfect storm.\n\nIn this video, Deborah speaks to Homeland Security Investigations about her experience being the target of an online romance scam and gives advice for others who may be targets.\n\nThe rise of romance scams\n\nLoneliness — especially during COVID-19 isolation periods — and the development of new technologies have contributed to the continued rise of romance scams. The number of older adults turning to the internet for dating has doubled over the past three years and 12% of those aged 55-64 reported using mobile dating apps. As Americans increasingly go online to find love, scammers are following suit.\n\nOlder adults reportedly lost nearly $139 million in romance scams in 2020.\n\nTotal reported losses to romance scams were higher than any other scam reported to the Federal Trade Commission in 2020. In 2020, people reported losing $304 million to romance scams – nine times higher than it was five years prior.\n\nAnd while dating scams can happen to people of all ages, it’s especially risky for older adults. Romance scams are riskiest to people in the 55 – 64 age group. Older adults reportedly lost nearly $139 million in romance scams in 2020. (FTC 2020 - 2021 Protecting Older Consumers Report).\n\nBank transfers and payments sent in connection with romance scams accounted for nearly $31 million in 2020, with older adults accounting for about a third of the dollars lost. Romance scammers reportedly took an additional $12 million total in cryptocurrency from older adults.\n\nHow HSI combats romance scams\n\nMany of these romance scams originate in west Africa, predominantly Nigeria and Ghana. Criminal organizations use legitimate dating apps to defraud people who are looking for love. The scammers strategically target recently widowed or divorced seniors due to their vulnerabilities and access to cash.\n\nIn order to combat criminal organizations involved in romance scams, HSI works closely with other Department of Homeland Security components, such as the U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the DHS Office of the Inspector General and the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigations, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the Internal Revenue Service. By operating in the United States, transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) pose significant multi-jurisdictional challenges to U.S. law enforcement. To combat this, HSI and its partner agencies have worked with the Department of Justice to produce a coordinated enforcement and prosecution effort. This effort involves law enforcement working jointly with prosecutors, our foreign law enforcement partners and the financial industry. This collaboration has led to a more cooperative law enforcement effort that will eventually lead to the disruption and dismantlement of the TCOs that victimize our senior citizens.\n\nTips to avoid losing money to a romance scam\n\nProtect yourself and older loved ones by raising awareness. Although this can be an uncomfortable topic, make sure you, your family and your friends are familiar with romance scams. The more you know about these scams, the better prepared you are to prevent being a victim.\n\nCheck in on older loved ones. Scammers are seeking to target those living alone or grieving the loss of a spouse as they are more vulnerable.\n\nLimit what you share online. Scammers can use details shared on social media and dating sites to better understand and target you.\n\nDo your research. Research the individual’s photo and profile using online searches to see if the image, name or other details have been used elsewhere.\n\nGo slowly and ask lots of questions. Don’t let the individual rush you to leave a dating service or social media site to communicate directly.\n\nListen to your gut. If the individual seems too good to be true, talk to someone you trust.\n\nDon’t overshare personal information. Requests for inappropriate photos or financial information could later be used to extort you.\n\nBe suspicious if you haven’t met in person. If the individual promises to meet in person, but consistently comes up with an excuse for cancelling, be suspicious.\n\nDon’t send money. Never send money to anyone you have only communicated with online or by phone.\n\nThink you’ve been scammed?\n\nStop communicating with the individual immediately.\n\nTalk to someone you trust and describe what’s going on.\n\nReport the incident to local law enforcement.\n\nSubmit a fraud complaint with the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nEven if it’s too late to recoup losses, details may help others from becoming a victim.\n\nCall 1-866-347-2423 to report suspicious criminal activity, including possible romance scams, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, every day of the year.",
